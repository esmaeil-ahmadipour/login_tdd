## Understanding Test-Driven Development (TDD) Process

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

## The steps of TDD are:

1. Write a test: Create a test for the desired functionality.

2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails: This confirms that the test is properly written and that it fails for the expected reason.

3. Write the code: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test.

4. Run tests: If all tests pass, the code is correct and complete.

5. Refactor code: Refactor the code to acceptable standards.

## Types of TDD:
1. Unit Testing: This type of testing focuses on individual units or components of a system, such as classes or methods.
2. Integration Testing: This type of testing focuses on how different components interact with each other.
3. Acceptance Testing: This type of testing focuses on verifying that a system meets its requirements and is ready for production use.
