## Understanding Test-Driven Development (TDD) Process

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

## The steps of TDD are:

1. Write a test: Create a test for the desired functionality.

2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails: This confirms that the test is properly written and that it fails for the expected reason.

3. Write the code: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test.

4. Run tests: If all tests pass, the code is correct and complete.

5. Refactor code: Refactor the code to acceptable standards.

## Types of TDD:
1. Widget testing: This type of testing in flutter , is a process of testing the UI of a widget to ensure that it is functioning as expected. It involves testing the widgetâ€™s visual elements, such as its size, color, and layout, as well as its interactive elements, such as buttons and text fields. Widget testing can be done manually or with automated tools.
2. Unit Testing: This type of testing focuses on individual units or components of a system, such as classes or methods.
3. Integration Testing: This type of testing focuses on how different components interact with each other.
